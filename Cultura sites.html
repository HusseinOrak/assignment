            <P>The culture of England is sometimes difficult to separate clearly from the culture of the United Kingdom, so influential has English culture been on the cultures of the British Isles and, on the other hand,
                given the extent to which other cultures have influenced life in England.

From the relatively tiny island in the North Atlantic, England has influenced virtually every other nation in the world. The country
has played a central and significant role in history as one of the world's most influential centers of cultural development. It is known throughout the world for its distinctive culture, habits, values, and traditions, and for
its rich and colorful history. Places, people, buildings, monuments, myths, and legends hold intrigue for many.</P>
