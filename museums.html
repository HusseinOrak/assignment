            <h2>Plan your visit to Manchester Museum with information on exhibitions, reviews and what's nearby.</h2>
            <p>Following the reopening of Manchester Museum in February 2023, a modern extension and beautiful galleries (as well as old favourites) provide opportunities for curiosity and wonder. There is a new Exhibition Hall, Belonging Gallery, Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery and South Asia Gallery, a British Museum partnership.

Displays and exhibitions will showcase the best of the museum’s historic collections, as well as addressing the urgencies of the present day and highlighting the complexities of our world. Golden Mummies of Egypt will be the first blockbuster exhibition opening in the new Exhibition Hall following a successful tour across USA and China. 

The museum has listened to advocates with lived experience, and inclusive spaces and features will be found throughout the building including a Changing Places toilet, picnic area, prayer room, quiet room and therapy room. </p>
