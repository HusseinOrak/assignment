            <p>OSMA neighbourhood bar and restaurant offers a weekly changing Scandi menu, and has been featured in the Michelin Guide for its beautiful way of crafting food. Guests can visit between 5 and 9pm on Wednesday and Thursday, and 12 and 9pm from Friday through to Saturday. On Sundays, a roast is served between midday and 6pm. The setting is everything that we love about Scandinavian decor, with plush bench sofas, wooden chairs with woven seats and low hanging warm lighting.</p>
            <p>The menu does change weekly, but guests can expect to find dishes on the menu that include fresh oysters with strawberry, lime and Thai basil at the bar, and pork belly croquettes with chive mayo on the snack menu. For starters, choose from dishes like stracciatella with roasted celeriac, chestnut, truffle and apple, and almond hummus with golden beetroot, figs, rocket and chamomile. Sushi lovers will enjoy the salmon sashimi with cucumber tiger milk, radish and basil.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the main menu, there are dishes like the roast cauliflower with wild mushroom, buerre blanc and blue cheese, along with lemon sole with green peppercorn, chard and tarragon and beef rump with roasted onions and Diane sauce.</p>
            <p>The sweet treats are equally as delicious. Choose from chocolate cheesecake with raspberries and chocolate ice cream, a damson and cherry Eton mess with almonds, and selection of British cheeses with chutney and crackers.</p>
            <p>Although the menu is delightful, it is worth noting that OSMA is unable to cater for a vegan or dairy free diet. Due to the nature of their small kitchen, they cannot guarantee that their dishes are completely ‘free from’ allergens. So, you’re advised to inform a member of the team if you have an allergy or intolerance before ordering.</p>
